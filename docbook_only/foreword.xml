  <title>Foreword</title>

  <para>The world of web services has been on a fast track to supernova ever
  since the architect astronauts spotted another meme to rocket out of
  pragmatism and into the universe of enterprisey. But thankfully all is not
  lost, for you can rewrite this placeholder text!</para>

  <para>If you want your Foreword to have an attribution at the end, use the
  <literal>&lt;prefaceinfo&gt;</literal> element as demonstrated here. The
  stylesheets will render this as a right-aligned “—Firstname Lastname” below
  the final paragraph.</para>
