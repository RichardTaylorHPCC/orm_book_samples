    <title>Using Code Examples</title>

    <remark>PROD: Please reach out to author to find out if they will be
    uploading code examples to oreilly.com or their own site (e.g., GitHub).
    If there is no code download, delete this whole section. If there is, when you email digidist with the link, let them know what you filled in for title_title (should be as close to book title as possible, i.e., learning_python_2e). This info will determine where digidist loads the files.</remark>

    <para>Supplemental material (code examples, exercises, etc.) is available
    for download at <ulink url="https://github.com/oreillymedia/title_title"></ulink>.</para>

    <para>This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if
    example code is offered with this book, you may use it in your programs
    and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless
    you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing
    a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require
    permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from Make:
    books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book
    and quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a
    significant amount of example code from this book into your product’s
    documentation does require permission.</para>

    <para>We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution
    usually includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN. For example:
    “<emphasis>Book Title</emphasis> by Some Author (O’Reilly). Copyright 2012
    Some Copyright Holder, 978-0-596-xxxx-x.”</para>

    <para>If you feel your use of code examples falls outside fair use or the
    permission given above, feel free to contact us at
    <email>bookpermissions@makermedia.com</email>.</para>
