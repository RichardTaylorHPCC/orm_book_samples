<section data-type="chapter">
<h1>Chapter Title</h1>

<p>Chapter text begins here. Replace any of this placeholder text with your opus. The following portion outlines heading levels and section structure.</p>

<section data-type="sect1">
<h1>This Is a Top-Level Heading (A-Head)&nbsp;</h1>

<p>Section text begins here.</p>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>This Is a Second-Level Heading (B-Head)</h2>

<p>Your text goes here.</p>

<section data-type="sect3">
<h3>This Is a Third-Level Heading (C-Head)</h3>

<p>Section content goes here.</p>

<section data-type="sect4">
<h4>This Is a Fourth-Level Heading (D-Head)</h4>

<p>Section content goes here.</p>

<section data-type="sect5">
<h5>This Is a Fifth-Level Heading</h5>

<p>This is the lowest level of section delineation available, but is not commonly used.</p>

<p>Next we've included a few examples of commonly used block elements. You can add these elements using the buttons in the toolbar, as well.</p>

<div data-type="note">
<h1>This Is a Note</h1>

<p>Many people use notes to qualify a statement they made in the preceding paragraphs, or to warn their readers about pitfalls they might run into.</p>
</div>

<div data-type="warning">
<p>This is a warning, used to alert readers to something important or encourage caution. Headings are optional for admonitions like notes and warnings.</p>
</div>

<p>Here is an informal code listing:</p>

<pre data-code-language="python" data-type="programlisting">
print('hello world')
</pre>

<p>And this is a formal listing, or example:</p>

<div data-type="example">
<h5>Hello World in Python</h5>

<pre data-code-language="python" data-type="programlisting">
print "Hello World"
# Formal listings have titles that will be numbered in output.
</pre>
</div>

<p>For either type of listing, you have the option of specifying the code language displayed; see <a href="http://docs.atlas.oreilly.com/ch05.html#idp1668976">http://docs.atlas.oreilly.com/ch05.html#idp1668976</a> for more details.</p>

<p>You can also specify inline text as code: <code>print "Hello World"</code>.</p>

<p>Now, let's take a look at a figure with a caption:</p>

<figure><img alt="Drawing of Tarsiers" src="images/tarsier.png" />
<figcaption>Figures like this will be automatically numbered in output.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here is a blockquote, and specifically it's an epigraph, with an author attribution (epigraphs are a subset of blockquotes):</p>

<blockquote data-type="epigraph">
<p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'</p>

<p data-type="attribution">Lewis Carroll, <em>Alice in Wonderland</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three types of lists available. Numbered (ordered) lists are often used to describe steps in a process:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Parse the request.</li>
	<li>Choose a handler function.</li>
	<li>Run the handler function.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bulleted (unordered) lists are good for describing a set of requirements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HTML source</li>
	<li>CSS stylesheets</li>
	<li>JavaScript code</li>
</ul>

<p>Definition/variable lists serve as glossaries of terminology:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>selectSource</dt>
	<dd>Returns a Source containing all the IDs and values from the database. This allows you to write streaming code.</dd>
	<dt>selectList</dt>
	<dd>Returns a list containing all the IDs and values from the database. All records will be loaded into memory.</dd>
	<dt>selectFirst</dt>
	<dd>Takes just the first ID and value from the database, if available.</dd>
	<dt>selectKeys</dt>
	<dd>Returns only the keys, without the values, as a <code>Source</code>.</dd>
</dl>

<aside data-type="sidebar">
<h5>Sidebar Title</h5>

<p>Here's a sidebar. Sidebars are great for setting aside a section of text that is related to the surrounding content but that doesn't necessarily fit into the main flow.</p>
</aside>

<p>Finally, here's a sample table:</p>

<table border="1">
	<caption>Features supported by Hadoop release series</caption>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<td>Feature</td>
			<td>1.x</td>
			<td>0.22</td>
			<td>2.x</td>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Secure authentication</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>No</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Old configuration names</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Deprecated</td>
			<td>Deprecated</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>New configuration names</td>
			<td>No</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Old MapReduce API</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>New MapReduce API</td>
			<td>Yes (with some missing libraries)</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
			<td>Yes</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
